	//String operations are performed on every new String
	//as it is a immutable object
	//to counter this, we have String pool
	//String str1="Aditya";
	//str1.intern(); //move to string pool
	// To implement hashMap we have to define two functions
	//hash code and equals- hash code will define the location and if there are many objects
	//then it will compare it with equals
	
	//Tree map is sorted by Red and black tree data structure
	The time complexity is log(n)
