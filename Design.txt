There has to be two users:
1) Consumers
2) Banking officials

1) Consumer- Will have all the information about a particular user. The information will include
	-Name
	-Account Number
	-Age
	-Balance
	-Account Type
	-PAN
Also, this will have two list, one for all the transaction that the user has made, which has to be verified by the 
our banking officials, after checking the necessary conditions, for example, if that particular user has to send 
the money to another account, he will just make a receipt of that. The banking official will after that check his
balance and the account number of the person to whom he is sending.
So, we will have two lists->
	- List one: To store all the transactions requested by the user, which after has been verified will be 
		     removed from this list.
	- List two: To store the last five transactions that have been approved by the banking officials, based on 
		    queue implementation.

2) Banking official- Will have the authority to validate any transaction requested by the user.
